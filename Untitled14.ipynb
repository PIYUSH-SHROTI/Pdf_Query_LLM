            "{'UNIT 2.2 (1).pdf': {0: 'Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share single physical instance of an \\napplication or resource among multiple organizations or customers. It does so by \\nassigning a logical name to a physical resource and providing a pointer to that \\nphysical resource on demand. Virtualization Concept Creating a virtual machine \\nover existing operating system and hardware is referred as Hardware Virtualization. \\nVirtual Machines provide an environment that is logically separated from the \\nunderlying hardware. The machine on which the virtual machine is created is known \\nas host machine and virtual machine is referred as a guest machine.  \\nMoreover, virtualization technologies provide a virtual environment for not only \\nexecuting applications but also for storage, memory, and networking. \\n \\nVirtualization technologies have gained renewed interested recently due to the of \\nseveral phenomena: \\n  \\n• Increased performance and computing capacity. Nowadays, the average end-user \\ndesktop PC is powerful enough to meet almost all the needs of everyday \\ncomputing, with extra capacity that is rarely used. Almost all these PCs have \\nresources enough to host a virtual machine manager and execute a virtual machine \\nwith by far acceptable performance. \\n• Underutilized hardware and software resources. Hardware and software \\nunderutilization is occurring due to (1) increased performance and computing \\ncapacity, and (2) the effect of limited use of resources. Computers today are so \\npowerful that in most cases only a fraction of their capacity is used by an \\napplication or the system. Moreover, if we consider the IT infrastructure of an \\nenterprise, many computers are only partially utilized whereas they could be used \\nwithout interruption on a 24/7/365 basis. For example, desktop PCs mostly \\ndevoted to office automation tasks and used by administrative staff are only used \\nduring work hours, remaining completely unused overnight. Using these resources \\nfor other purposes after hours could improve the efficiency of the IT \\ninfrastructure.  \\n  \\n• Lack of space. The continuous need for additional capacity, whether storage or \\ncompute power, makes data centres grow quickly. Companies such as Google and \\nMicrosoft expand their infrastructures by building data centres as large as football \\nfields that are able to host thousands of nodes.  \\n \\n', 1: '• Greening initiatives. Recently, companies are increasingly looking for ways to \\nreduce the amount of energy they consume and to reduce their carbon footprint. \\nData centers are one of the major power consumers; they contribute consistently \\nto the impact that a company has on the environment. Maintaining a data center \\noperation not only involves keeping servers on, but a great deal of energy is also \\nconsumed in keeping them cool. Infrastructures for cooling have a significant \\nimpact on the carbon footprint of a data center. Hence, reducing the number of \\nservers through server consolidation will definitely reduce the impact of cooling \\nand power consumption of a data center. Virtualization technologies can provide \\nan efficient way of consolidating servers. \\n \\n• Rise of administrative costs. Power consumption and cooling costs have now \\nbecome higher than the cost of IT equipment. Moreover, the increased demand \\nfor additional capacity, which translates into more servers in a data center, is also \\nresponsible for a significant increment in administrative costs. Computers—in \\nparticular, servers—do not operate all on their own, but they require care and \\nfeeding from system administrators. Common system administration tasks include \\nhardware monitoring, defective hardware replacement, server setup and updates, \\nserver resources monitoring, and backups.  \\n \\n \\n \\nCharacteristics of virtualized environments \\n \\n \\nVirtualization is a concept that refers to the creation of a virtual version of \\nsomething, whether hardware, a software environment, storage, or a network. In \\na virtualized environment there are three major components:  \\n1. Guest \\n2. Host \\n3. Virtualization layer.  \\nThe guest represents the system component that interacts with the virtualization \\nlayer. The guest is represented by a system image comprising an operating system \\nand installed applications. These are installed on top of virtual hardware that is \\ncontrolled and managed by the virtualization layer, also called the virtual machine \\nmanager. \\nThe host represents the original environment where the guest is supposed to be \\nmanaged. The host is represented by the physical hardware, and in some cases the \\n', 2: 'operating system, that defines the environment where the virtual machine manager \\nis running. \\nThe virtualization layer is responsible for recreating the same or a different \\nenvironment where the guest will operate. \\nThe main common characteristic of all these different implementations is the fact \\nthat the virtual environment is created by means of a software program. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nIncreased security \\n \\nThe ability to control the execution of a guest in a completely transparent manner \\nopens new possibilities for delivering a secure, controlled execution environment. \\nThe virtual machine represents an environment in which the guest is executed. All \\nthe operations of the guest are generally performed against the virtual machine, \\nwhich then translates and applies them to the host. This level of indirection allows \\nthe virtual machine manager to control and filter the activity of the guest, thus \\npreventing some harmful operations. Resources exposed by the host can then be \\nhidden or simply protected from the guest.  \\n \\n', 3: 'Increased security is a requirement when dealing with untrusted code. Hardware \\nvirtualization solutions such as VMware Desktop and VirtualBox provide the ability \\nto create a virtual computer with customized virtual hardware on top of which a new \\noperating system can be installed. By default, the file system exposed by the virtual \\ncomputer is completely separated from the one of the host machine. This becomes \\nthe perfect environment for running applications without affecting other users in the \\nenvironment. \\nManaged execution \\n \\nVirtualization of the execution environment not only allows increased security, but \\na wider range of features also can be implemented. In particular, sharing, \\naggregation, emulation, and isolation are the most relevant features. \\n \\n \\n \\n• Sharing. Virtualization allows the creation of a separate computing environments \\nwithin the same host. In this way it is possible to fully exploit the capabilities of a \\npowerful guest, which would otherwise be underutilized. Sharing is a particularly \\nimportant feature in virtualized data centers, where this basic feature is used to \\nreduce the number of active servers and limit power consumption. \\n \\n• Aggregation. Not only have to share physical resource among several guests, but \\nvirtualization also allowed aggregation, which is the opposite process. A group of \\nseparate hosts can be tied together and represented to guests as a single virtual \\nhost.  \\n \\n• Emulation. Guest programs are executed within an environment that is controlled \\nby the virtualization layer, which ultimately is a program. This allows for \\ncontrolling and tuning the environment that is exposed to guests. This feature \\nbecomes very useful for testing purposes, where a specific guest has to be \\nvalidated against different platforms or architectures and the wide range of options \\nis not easily accessible during development.  \\n', 4: ' \\n• \\nIsolation. Virtualization allows providing guests—whether they are \\noperating systems, applications, or other entities—with a completely \\nseparate environment, in which they are executed. The guest program \\nperforms its activity by interacting with an abstraction layer, which provides \\naccess to the underlying resources. Isolation brings several benefits; for \\nexample, it allows multiple guests to run on the same host without \\ninterfering with each other. Second, it provides a separation between the host \\nand the guest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'}, 'Unit-2 PME  notes.pdf': {0: 'Unit-2 \\nENTREPRENEURIAL IDEA AND INNOVATION \\n \\nINTRODUCTION TO INNOVATION: \\nInnovation is the process and outcome of creating something new, which is also of value. \\nInnovation involves the whole process from opportunity identification, ideation or \\ninvention to development, prototyping, production marketing and sales, while \\nentrepreneurship only needs to involve commercialization. \\nInnovation is about helping organizations grow. Growth is often measured in terms of \\nturnover and profit, but can also occur in knowledge, in human experience, and in \\nefficiency and quality.  \\nInnovation is the process of making changes, large and small, radical and incremental, to \\nproducts, processes, and services those results in the introduction of something new for \\nthe organization that adds value to customers and contributes to the knowledge store of \\nthe organization. \\nApplying innovation is the application of practical tools and techniques that make \\nchanges, large and small, to products, processes, and services those results in the \\nintroduction of something new for the organization that adds value to customers and \\ncontributes to the knowledge store of the organization. \\nInnovation = Invention + Exploitation \\n \\nTYPES OF INNOVATION: \\n1. Incremental Innovation \\nIncremental can be perceived as continuous innovation. It builds on existing knowledge \\nof technology to continuously improve on the existing product in the minority and \\ntargeted existing markets. \\n \\n2. Radical Innovation \\nRadical innovation is the opposite concept of Incremental innovation. This one applied \\neither new technology or combine new with existing technologies, which targets new \\nmarkets to build new products. \\nMostly, the company use radical innovation to create short-term competitive advantages \\nand then apply incremental innovation to sustain its potential gains. \\nGillette is a good example that involves both innovations. Gillette launched its radical \\ninnovation as a disposable blade that can be replaced in the razor. Then Gillette sustains \\nits profitable business by introduced various versions of razor blade; pack of 3 blades or 5 \\nblades with new razor model. \\n \\n3. Architectural Innovation \\nArchitectural innovation is a redesigned method to move products/services into a new \\nmarket, still based on existing knowledge of core technology. \\nCanon is the main competitor of Xerox in photocopiers. Canon can win over Xerox, \\nbecause of its physical transformation in photocopies machine. What Xerox offered is a \\nbig giant copying machine that requires particular space in large-sized businesses. \\nWhereas Canon redesigned huge photocopiers into desktop photocopiers that still contain \\nexisting compact concepts of functions. \\n4. Disruptive Innovation \\nDisruptive innovation is a new product that disrupts the existing market with the help of \\nnew technologies. It often starts at low-demanding customers with a ―good enough‖ \\nproduct performance. \\n', 1: 'Kodak, film camera, died as a result of the disruption of a digital camera. There are fewer \\nusers due to the fewer photo can be taken and the high cost of printing per shot. Whereas \\nDigital camera offers more photo taken and pictures can be viewed and edited more than \\nonce without add-up cost. For example, Sony, Nikon, and Canon can utilise new \\ntechnology to get a job done of customer value in taking quick photo and post on social \\nmedia rather than waiting for a week to get the picture and viewed once then stored in the \\nboxes. \\n \\nEntrepreneurial Idea Generation: \\nIdea generation is described as the process of creating, developing and communicating \\nabstract, concrete or visual ideas. It is the front end part of the idea management funnel \\nand it focuses on coming up with possible solutions to be perceived or actual problems \\nand opportunities. \\nFor example: \\nIt was the creative imagination of Ratan Tata that led to the creation of Nano, a low \\nbudget passenger car for middle class families in India. \\n \\n―Creative thinking inspires ideas. Ideas inspire change.‖ – Barbara Janusz kiewicz \\n \\nTo be successful, the entrepreneur needs to begin with basics i.e., to generate ideas, check \\nviability and finally seize the opportunity. Hence, ideas have to be shaped into \\nopportunities after systematic research based on available data, market characteristics and \\ncompetitor actions. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n', 2: ' \\nIDENTIFYING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES: \\nObjectives of Identification of Business Opportunities \\n1. Identification of opportunities by an entrepreneur, in the context of probable industries \\nand to decide his own role, the scope of work, and relationships, in accordance with the \\nopportunities. \\n2. To keep watch over the possible market of the commodity or service to be produced. \\n3. To decide a high-level group of managers, so that entrepreneurial ventures may be \\nstarted. \\n4. To make an assessment of financial resources by making financial forecasts, in the \\ncontext of the process if industrial development. \\n5. To explore the opportunities for possible entry in other areas. \\n6. To assess the requirements of labor, capital, and materials for the industries. \\n7. To find out the possibilities of short term and long term development in various areas of \\nthe economy. \\n8. To have the desire for technical knowledge, awareness towards new opportunities, and \\nacceptance of the changes. \\n9. To see the possibilities of diverting the available resources towards achieving \\nthe business objectives. \\n10. To identify those industries, which are not based on local sources, but which may be \\neconomically considered, in view of future requirements. \\nHere we discuss four ways to identify more business opportunities: \\nTo be successful entrepreneurs, we need to be continually innovating and looking for \\nopportunities to grow our startups. \\n \\n1. Listen to your potential clients and past leads \\nWhen you’re targeting potential customers listen to their needs, wants, challenges and \\nfrustrations with your industry. Have they used similar products and services before? \\nWhat did they like and dislike? Why did they come to you? What are their objections to \\nyour products or services? \\nThis will help you to find opportunities to develop more tailored products and services, \\nhone your target market and identify and overcome common objections. \\n \\n2. Listen to your customers \\nWhen you’re talking to your customers listen to what they saying about your industry, \\nproducts and services. What are their frequently asked questions? Experiences? \\nFrustrations? Feedback and complaints? \\nThis valuable customer information will help you identify key business opportunities to \\nexpand and develop your current products and services. \\n \\n3. Look at your competitors \\nDo a little competitive analysis (don’t let it lead to competitive paralysis though) to see \\nwhat other startups are doing, and more importantly, not doing?  \\nWhere are they falling down?  \\nWhat are they doing right?  \\nWhat makes customers go to them over you? \\nAnalysing your competitors will help you identify key business opportunities to expand \\nyour market reach and develop your products and services. \\n \\n', 3: ' \\n4. Look at industry trends and insights \\nSubscribe to industry publications, join relevant associations, set Google alerts for key \\nindustry terms and news and follow other industry experts on social media. \\nAbsorb yourself in your industry and continually educate yourself on the latest techniques \\nand trends. \\n \\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER IN IDENTIFYING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES: \\nThe following factors affecting the Identification of business opportunities may be \\nmentioned, which should be considered, while identifying the business opportunities. \\n1. Analysis of Internal Demand \\n2. Availability of Raw Materials \\n3. External Assistance \\n4. Knowledge about Industrial Development \\n5. Internal Sources \\n6. Risk in Business Opportunities \\n7. Performance of Existing Units \\n8. Promote Entrepreneurial Activity \\nChallenges of Identification of Business Opportunities: \\n1. Initial Crisis in Beginning of Business \\n2. Promotion of an Entrepreneurial Venture \\n3. Financial Challenges \\n4. Innovation of New Product \\n5. Unhealthy Competition \\n6. Decision-Making and Leadership \\nMANAGERIAL SKILLS FOR SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR \\nA successful entrepreneur is the one who is focused on making their decisions and \\neliminate the obstacles that arise when achieving the goals. Certain qualities are required \\nfor the entrepreneur to achieve the best goal. \\n1) Time Management \\nTime is an important factor to make decisions. The success of an entrepreneur depends \\nupon how they utilize their time in evaluating and prioritizing their tasks according to \\nrelevance and importance. They have responsibilities towards their partners, customers \\nand employees to make most out of their time. Effective time management skills enable \\nentrepreneurs to expeditiously complete essential tasks. They must manage their \\nprofessional life in conjunction with their family life, making a balance between work \\nand home. \\n2) Opportunity Recognition \\nThe seed of every successful business is a great Idea. They must recognize the \\nopportunities on time that are unique and gives a competitive advantage. A good \\nopportunity only comes when an effective market research is done. They must take the \\nviews of industry experts and must utilize the information gained from organizational \\nexperience. \\n', 4: \" \\n3) Business Planning \\nSuccessful business involves proper utilization of managerial skills and formulation \\nof an effective business plan. The planning is required from the start of the business \\ntill the entrepreneur achieves the goal. Business planning includes the ability to \\nmanage the future forecasting in each aspect. \\n4) Information Gathering \\nReliable information is required to ensure those right decisions are made. Successful \\nentrepreneurs often make information gathering one of their top priorities. An \\nentrepreneur's close associates are the most valuable resource for gathering actionable \\ninformation. Motivation is required for the associates to share their learning and \\nexperience. Successfully gathering the right information enables entrepreneurs to take \\nthe decisions better than the competitors in the market. \\n5) Rational Decision Making \\nEntrepreneurs cannot expect to succeed without nurturing their ability to make \\nrational decisions. Decisions can be taken for long term or short term depending upon \\nthe working of the business. Many entrepreneurs underestimate the importance of \\ngiving time in taking the right decisions; as a result, they make impulsive decisions \\nbased on intuition or conjecture. \\n6) Employee Management \\nSuccessful businesspeople evaluate potential employees, hire and train workers and \\nput them in appropriate positions in her company. They must find people who will \\nwork well together and makes organization goals as their own achievements. Once \\nemployees are on the job, a successful entrepreneur needs to have the ability to \\nmanage teams, oversee conflict and dispute resolution and provide ongoing training \\nto encourage high-quality performance. \\n7) Communication Skills \\nAn entrepreneur must be a good orator with best communication skills. They must be \\nable to communicate with the people with whom they work. A good understanding \\nbetween businessmen and its fellow persons makes the work easier. Entrepreneurs \\nwith strong communication skills can find it easier to communicate with partners, \\nacquire \\nfunding, \\nand \\ndevelop \\nrelationships \\nwith \\nprospective \\ncustomers. \\nCommunication skills can also make it easier to manage associates who work for the \\nenterprise. \\n \\n8) Leadership \\nLeadership quality is essential for every entrepreneur to make the whole team work \\ntogether and give their best in achieving the goal. Entrepreneurs must possess \\nadequate leadership skills to effectively coordinate the efforts of everyone involved in \\n\", 5: \"an enterprise. Leadership skills can be learned through experience and formal \\neducation on leadership techniques. \\n9) Business Management \\nSuccessful entrepreneurs must have strong overall business management skills. They \\nmust understand all the aspects of how his business operates, including the regulatory \\nrequirements of his industry. They should have knowledge about labor, employment, \\nand tax laws, and must stay abreast of industry and market trends. This will help him \\nquickly change direction if economic conditions dictate. \\n10) Financial Management \\nHiring an accountant or finance professional to track money and other assets is \\nresponsible for the financial management of the company. It is significant when the \\ncompany is at the growth stage and is bringing the investors. A successful \\nentrepreneur has the management skills necessary to review books and financial \\nstatements to ensure that he is always aware of his business's finances. \\n \\nMANAGING FOR VALUE CREATION: \\nThe value creation process is at the heart of integrated thinking and value \\ncreation. Strategically, the business model is a central cog in the value creation \\nprocess which turns valuable resources and relationships (inputs) into results \\n(outputs) that create value for stakeholders and society (outcomes and impacts). \\nValue for customers and other stakeholders is ultimately created or destroyed \\nthrough the business and operating model. \\nMany organizations undertaking integrated reporting using the international \\nintegrated reporting framework to set out their value creation and business model \\nas a central part of their integrated reporting. \\nThis approach provides a tool to connect purpose, strategy and the value creation \\nprocess across relevant capitals, outcomes and impacts. \\nEnsuring that value is created over time involves making significant decisions on \\nwhere the business competes (e.g., markets, geography, segments), identifying the \\nprincipal opportunities and risks related to the strategy and business model, \\nensuring products and services meet customer needs and respond to societal \\nchallenges, and collaborating with critical partners in value creation. To create \\nlong-term value, organizations need to put in place the infrastructure, capability \\nand relationships (tangible and intangible assets) that enable them to meet the \\nneeds of their customers and stakeholders. \\nConsequently, capital and resource allocation decisions are a critical part of how \\nvalue is created and sustained. Investments in capital maintenance and \\ndevelopment of strategic assets and capabilities such as talent, innovation, \\ninfrastructure, brand and intellectual assets enable value to be created. They need \\nto be considered beyond estimated financial returns and in the context of internal \\nand external stakeholder outcomes, and a wider set of impacts. \\n \\nORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS: \\n \\nOrganizational effectiveness refers to how an organization has achieved full self- \\n \\nawareness due in part to: \\n\", 6: 'Leaders setting well-defined goals for employees and outlining ways to efficiently \\nexecute those goals. \\nManagement implementing clear decision-making processes and communication \\npipelines. \\nEngaged employees—who are carefully selected and fairly compensated—\\nproducing work that prioritizes results. \\n \\nFIVE WAY TO ACHIEVE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS: \\n\\uf0b7 Strategy \\nStrategy involves shifting an organization’s central identity—how leaders \\ndescribe its purpose and goals both internally and externally—to include \\neffectiveness and efficiency as core values.  \\nThe more your company is known to be ―effective‖ and ―efficient,‖ by both the \\nmarket and your employees, the more these values will be built into every new \\nproject and goal. \\nOrganizational effectiveness should simplify and clarify long-term objectives for \\na company. The clearer these objectives are outlined at a strategic level, the easier \\nit is to translate across departments. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Metrics \\nMeasuring organizational effectiveness through metrics can help organizations \\nstay accountable. But choosing the right data to measure—as well as knowing \\nwhen to prize human judgment and discussion over hard analytics—is just as \\nimportant. \\n It clearly states the organization’s strategic focus, efforts to promote clarity in \\nroles, as well as recommendations for improving general administration \\norganizational design. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Commitment \\n―Strong executive sponsorship is the single most important factor for success and \\nthe most often cited reason for failure when things go off track,‖ the Bain & \\nCompany study says.  \\nThe authors stress that ―visible and credible commitment‖ to effectiveness \\npolicies from senior leaders—in companywide communications and hiring \\napproaches, all the way down to how quarterly budget meetings are conducted—\\ncreates a trickle-down effect across the organization. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Behavior \\nMeanwhile, recurring behavior is where efforts to achieve organizational \\neffectiveness are most likely to break down. Identifying specific decision-making \\nmoments in the day-to-day operation of the company, communicating the ways \\nemployees ought to be changing their behavior in those moments, and then \\nimplementing systems for reinforcement, including incentivizing those choices, \\ncan build a much healthier organization that polices its own effectiveness. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Culture \\nFinally, the degree to which employees are enthusiastically engaged at work \\ndetermines how effective their work will be.  \\nTherefore, creating an organizational culture that values effectiveness is key. \\n'}}\n",
